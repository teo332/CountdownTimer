# 20 min CountdownTimer

This program was built with the ideea of respecting the 20-20-20 rule which for someone who sits all day staring at a screen could be beneficial.
It consists in that after every 20 minutes spent working, take a 20 seconds break and look at something 20 meters away(something out on the window).
Respecting this rule can help you reduce eye strain and improve focus(I`ve tested it and it works).
And this program does just like that. It has a small GUI interface that shows you how much time you have left and a reset button.
Every 20 minutes when the timer reaches 0 it plays a sound to remind you that is time for a break.
After the break simply press the reset button and the timer starts counting down again.

This is my first ever program that actually has a utility.
Enjoy:)
